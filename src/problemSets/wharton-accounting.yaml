reference: Lesson 1.1.1 Financial Reporting Overview
question: What are the required financial statements?
answer: |
  * Balance sheet: financial position on a certain date
  * Income statement: results of operations over a certain period of time using accrual accounting (i.e. according to business activities, not cash flows)
  * Statement of cash flows: sources and uses of cash over a certain period of time
  * Statement of stockholder equity: changes in stockholder equity over a certain period of time

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Cash Flow report?
answer: |
  * CFO: Cash Flow from Operations: from provision of goods and services and other normal business activities
  * CFI: Cash Flow from Investing: from acquisition and disposal of long-lived productive assets
  * CFF: Cash Flow from Financing: from transactions with owners and creditors

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: How does *accrual accounting* relate to cash flow?
answer: >
  It is not directly related to cash flow.
  It calculates transactions based on business activities in a certain time period,
  so for example, while you might have an out-flow of cash for long-lived equipment in
  January, in accrual accounting you would depreciate that expense over the
  equipment's lifetime, rather than considering the full price to be an expense
  in January.

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on an Income Statement?
answer: |
  * Revenues: increases in owner equity from providing goods or services
  * Expenses: decreases in owner equity incurred in the process of generating revenues
  * Net income = Revenues - Expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Balance Sheet?
answer: |
  * Assets: resources owned by the business that are expected to provide future economic benefits
  * Liabilities: claims on assets by creditors
  * Stockholder Equity: claims on assets by owners of the business (contributed capital and retained earnings)

  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the *Balance Sheet Equation*?
answer: |
  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

  Another way to say this is: Resources = Claims on Resources by Ousiders and Owners

  A more detailed equation is:

  assets = liabilities + contributed capital + prior retained earnings + revenues - expenses - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What are the two components of *Stockholder's Equity*?
answer: |
  * Contributed capital: money we raise from shareholders
  * Retained earnings: profits from operating the business

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *retained earnings*?
answer: retained earnings = prior retained earnings + net income - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *net income*?
answer: Net income = revenues - expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: assets = 100, liabilities = 50, what is stockholder's equity?
answer: |
  50.

  assets (100) = liabilities (50) + stockholder's equity (50)

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: noncash assets = 70, liabilities = 60, stockholder's equity = 30.  What is cash?
answer: |
  20.

  70 + x = 60 + 30

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Retained earnings increases by 100, dividends = 50.  What is net income?
answer: |
  * net income = revenues - expenses
  * retained income = previous retained income + net income - dividends
  * 100 = net income - 50
  * net income = 150

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Revenue increases by 100 and all other categories are unchanged excepts assets.  What is the change in assets?
answer: |
 100.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be an asset?
answer: |
  * It is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benefits (i.e. generate future cash inflows or reduce cash outflows)
  * It is acquired in a past transaction or exchange
  * The value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC sells $100,000 of merchandise to a customer that promises to pay cash within 60 days?"
answer: |
  Yes.  1) it is expected to provide future cash inflow, 2) it was "acquired" in a transaction, and 3) its future benefit can be estimated.

  It would belong to "Accounts Receivable".

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC signs a contract to deliver $100,000 of natural gas to DEF each month for the next year?"
answer: |
  No, because no products or services have been exchanged.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC pays $12 million for the annual rent on its office building and has already occupied it for one month?"
answer: |
  The asset is "Prepaid Rent" and is worth $11 million.
  $1 million has gone to the "Rent" expense.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC's brand name has been estimated to be worth $63 million?"
answer: |
  It is not an asset in financial accounting, because there was no transaction,
  and can't be precisely valued.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be a liability?
answer: |
  * It is an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services
  * It is based on benefits or services received in the past
  * The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC estimates that it owes $3 million in taxes for the quarter?"
answer: |
  Yes, this is a liability in the "Income Tax Payable" account.
  The "benefits received" criteria is met because we receive the benefit to
  operate the business from the government.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC borrows $500,000 on a one-year note with a 10% interest rate?"
answer: |
  This is a liability in "Notes payable" worth $500,000.
  The interest obligations will only be booked as times passes.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are *dividends*?
answer: |
  * Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders.
  * They are not considered an expense.
  * They are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date.
  * Until the dividends are actually paid, they become a payable liability.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: What are the three fundamental bookeeping equations?
answer: |
  * assets = liabilities + stockholder's equity
  * sum of debits = sum of credits
  * beginning account balance + increase - decreases = ending account balance

  That first equation is the *balance sheet equation*.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: In accounting, what is the definition of "debits" and "credits"?
answer: >
  A debit is a left-side entry and a credit is a right-side entry in this
  equation:

  assets + expenses = liability + contributed capital + retained earnings + revenues

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: How are "debit" and "credit" abbreviated in accounting?
answer: "Dr." and "Cr.", respectively.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: How does *accounting income* differ from *cash in/cash out*?
answer: >
  Accounting income is based on accrual accounting, and it tries to consider
  business activities, rather than cash flow.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing revenues?
answer: |
  Revenue is recognized when BOTH:

  1) Income has been earned (e.g. by providing a product or service), AND
  2) Income has been "realized" (cash has been received or a document which will be converted to cash has been produced, such as a bill)
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing expenses?
answer: |
  Expenses are recognized:

  * When an associated revenue has been recognized (product costs), OR
  * If it's difficult to associate the expense with a revenue, when the cost has been incurred (period costs or unusual costs).
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What is the *conservatism principle*?
answer: |
  Recognize anticipated losses immediately, but
  only recognized anticipated gains when they are realized.

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What are *adjusting entries*?
answer: >
  Adjusting entries are internal transactions that update account balances
  in accordance with accrual accounting prior to the preparation of
  financial statements.

  formal transactions created by the accountant.  They there never involve
  cash.
