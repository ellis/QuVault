question: How does *accrual accounting* relate to cash flow?
answer: >
  It is not directly related to cash flow.
  It calculates transactions based on business activities in a certain time period,
  so for example, while you might have an out-flow of cash for long-lived equipment in
  January, in accrual accounting you would depreciate that expense over the
  equipment's lifetime, rather than considering the full price to be an expense
  in January.

question: Which sections are on a Balance Sheet?
answer: |
  * Assets: resources owned by the business that are expected to provide future economic benefits
  * Liabilities: claims on assets by creditors
  * Stockholder Equity: claims on assets by owners of the business (contributed capital and retained earnings)

  Assets = Liabilities + Stockhold Equity
