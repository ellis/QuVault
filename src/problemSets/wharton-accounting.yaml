question: What are the required financial statements?
answer: |
  * Balance sheet: financial position on a certain date
  * Income statement: results of operations over a certain period of time using accrual accounting (i.e. according to business activities, not cash flows)
  * Statement of cash flows: sources and uses of cash over a certain period of time
  * Statement of stockholder equity: changes in stockholder equity over a certain period of time

reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Cash Flow report?
answer: |
  * CFO: Cash Flow from Operations: from provision of goods and services and other normal business activities
  * CFI: Cash Flow from Investing: from acquisition and disposal of long-lived productive assets
  * CFF: Cash Flow from Financing: from transactions with owners and creditors

reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: How does *accrual accounting* relate to cash flow?
answer: >
  It is not directly related to cash flow.
  It calculates transactions based on business activities in a certain time period,
  so for example, while you might have an out-flow of cash for long-lived equipment in
  January, in accrual accounting you would depreciate that expense over the
  equipment's lifetime, rather than considering the full price to be an expense
  in January.

question: Which sections are on an Income Statement?
answer: |
  * Revenues: increases in owner equity from providing goods or services
  * Expenses: decreases in owner equity incurred in the process of generating revenues
  * Net income = Revenues - Expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Balance Sheet?
answer: |
  * Assets: resources owned by the business that are expected to provide future economic benefits
  * Liabilities: claims on assets by creditors
  * Stockholder Equity: claims on assets by owners of the business (contributed capital and retained earnings)

  Assets = Liabilities + Stockhold Equity

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the *Balance Sheet Equation*?
answer: |
  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

  Another way to say this is: Resources = Claims on Resources by Ousiders and Owners

  A more detailed equation is:

  assets = liabilities + contributed capital + prior retained earnings + revenues - expenses - dividends

reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What are the two components of *Stockholder's Equity*?
answer: |
  * Contributed capital: money we raise from shareholders
  * Retained earnings: profits from operating the business

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *retained earnings*?
answer: retained earnings = prior retained earnings + net income - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *net income*?
answer: Net income = revenues - expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: assets = 100, liabilities = 50, what is stockholder's equity?
answer: |
  50.

  assets (100) = liabilities (50) + stockholder's equity (50)

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: noncash assets = 70, liabilities = 60, stockholder's equity = 30.  What is cash?
answer: |
  20.

  70 + x = 60 + 30

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Retained earnings increases by 100, dividends = 50.  What is net income?
answer: |
  * net income = revenues - expenses
  * retained income = previous retained income + net income - dividends
  * 100 = net income - 50
  * net income = 150

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Revenue increases by 100 and all other categories are unchanged excepts assets.  What is the change in assets?
answer: |
 100.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be an asset?
answer: |
  * It is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benefits (i.e. generate future cash inflows or reduce cash outflows)
  * It is acquired in a past transaction or exchange
  * The value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC sells $100,000 of merchandise to a customer that promises to pay cash within 60 days?
answer: |
  Yes.  1) it is expected to provide future cash inflow, 2) it was "acquired" in a transaction, and 3) its future benefit can be estimated.

  It would belong to "Accounts Receivable".
