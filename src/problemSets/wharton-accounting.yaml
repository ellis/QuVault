reference: Lesson 1.1.1 Financial Reporting Overview
question: What are the required financial statements?
answer: |
  * Balance sheet: financial position on a certain date
  * Income statement: results of operations over a certain period of time using accrual accounting (i.e. according to business activities, not cash flows)
  * Statement of cash flows: sources and uses of cash over a certain period of time
  * Statement of stockholder equity: changes in stockholder equity over a certain period of time

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Cash Flow report?
answer: |
  * CFO: Cash Flow from Operations: from provision of goods and services and other normal business activities
  * CFI: Cash Flow from Investing: from acquisition and disposal of long-lived productive assets
  * CFF: Cash Flow from Financing: from transactions with owners and creditors

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: How does *accrual accounting* relate to cash flow?
answer: >
  It is not directly related to cash flow.
  It calculates transactions based on business activities in a certain time period,
  so for example, while you might have an out-flow of cash for long-lived equipment in
  January, in accrual accounting you would depreciate that expense over the
  equipment's lifetime, rather than considering the full price to be an expense
  in January.

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on an Income Statement?
answer: |
  * Revenues: increases in owner equity from providing goods or services
  * Expenses: decreases in owner equity incurred in the process of generating revenues
  * Net income = Revenues - Expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Balance Sheet?
answer: |
  * Assets: resources owned by the business that are expected to provide future economic benefits
  * Liabilities: claims on assets by creditors
  * Stockholder Equity: claims on assets by owners of the business (contributed capital and retained earnings)

  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the *Balance Sheet Equation*?
answer: |
  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

  Another way to say this is: Resources = Claims on Resources by Ousiders and Owners

  A more detailed equation is:

  assets = liabilities + contributed capital + prior retained earnings + revenues - expenses - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What are the two components of *Stockholder's Equity*?
answer: |
  * Contributed capital: money we raise from shareholders
  * Retained earnings: profits from operating the business

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *retained earnings*?
answer: retained earnings = prior retained earnings + net income - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *net income*?
answer: Net income = revenues - expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: assets = 100, liabilities = 50, what is stockholder's equity?
answer: |
  50.

  assets (100) = liabilities (50) + stockholder's equity (50)

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: noncash assets = 70, liabilities = 60, stockholder's equity = 30.  What is cash?
answer: |
  20.

  70 + x = 60 + 30

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Retained earnings increases by 100, dividends = 50.  What is net income?
answer: |
  * net income = revenues - expenses
  * retained income = previous retained income + net income - dividends
  * 100 = net income - 50
  * net income = 150

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Revenue increases by 100 and all other categories are unchanged excepts assets.  What is the change in assets?
answer: |
 100.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be an asset?
answer: |
  * It is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benefits (i.e. generate future cash inflows or reduce cash outflows)
  * It is acquired in a past transaction or exchange
  * The value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC sells $100,000 of merchandise to a customer that promises to pay cash within 60 days?"
answer: |
  Yes.  1) it is expected to provide future cash inflow, 2) it was "acquired" in a transaction, and 3) its future benefit can be estimated.

  It would belong to "Accounts Receivable".

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC signs a contract to deliver $100,000 of natural gas to DEF each month for the next year?"
answer: |
  No, because no products or services have been exchanged.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC pays $12 million for the annual rent on its office building and has already occupied it for one month?"
answer: |
  The asset is "Prepaid Rent" and is worth $11 million.
  $1 million has gone to the "Rent" expense.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC's brand name has been estimated to be worth $63 million?"
answer: |
  It is not an asset in financial accounting, because there was no transaction,
  and can't be precisely valued.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be a liability?
answer: |
  * It is an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services
  * It is based on benefits or services received in the past
  * The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC estimates that it owes $3 million in taxes for the quarter?"
answer: |
  Yes, this is a liability in the "Income Tax Payable" account.
  The "benefits received" criteria is met because we receive the benefit to
  operate the business from the government.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC borrows $500,000 on a one-year note with a 10% interest rate?"
answer: |
  This is a liability in "Notes payable" worth $500,000.
  The interest obligations will only be booked as times passes.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are *dividends*?
answer: |
  * Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders.
  * They are not considered an expense.
  * They are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date.
  * Until the dividends are actually paid, they become a payable liability.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: What are the three fundamental bookeeping equations?
answer: |
  * assets = liabilities + stockholder's equity
  * sum of debits = sum of credits
  * beginning account balance + increase - decreases = ending account balance

  That first equation is the *balance sheet equation*.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: In accounting, what is the definition of "debits" and "credits"?
answer: >
  A debit is a left-side entry and a credit is a right-side entry in this
  equation:

  assets + expenses = liability + contributed capital + retained earnings + revenues

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: How are "debit" and "credit" abbreviated in accounting?
answer: "Dr." and "Cr.", respectively.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I

question: How do you satisfy the balance sheet equation if liabilities are greater than assets?  Consider that debits and credits are always positive numbers.
answer: |
  Retained earnings (within Shareholder's Equity) is the one account that can have a positive or negative balance, in order to allow for such situations.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: How does *accounting income* differ from *cash in/cash out*?
answer: >
  Accounting income is based on accrual accounting, and it tries to consider
  business activities, rather than cash flow.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing revenues?
answer: |
  Revenue is recognized when BOTH:

  1) Income has been earned (e.g. by providing a product or service), AND
  2) Income has been "realized" (cash has been received or a document which will be converted to cash has been produced, such as a bill)
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing expenses?
answer: |
  Expenses are recognized:

  * When an associated revenue has been recognized (product costs), OR
  * If it's difficult to associate the expense with a revenue, when the cost has been incurred (period costs or unusual costs).
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What is the *conservatism principle*?
answer: |
  Recognize anticipated losses immediately, but
  only recognized anticipated gains when they are realized.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: How much revenue is recognized in December: BOC leases space to a client for $20,000 for December and January.
answer: |
  $10,000, because they have only earned the income for December so far.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What is the distinction between *cost* and *expense* in this course?
answer: |
  An expense is only something that goes on the income statement.
  A cost is anything involving an outlay of cash.

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What are *adjusting entries*?
answer: >
  Adjusting entries are internal transactions that update account balances
  in accordance with accrual accounting prior to the preparation of
  financial statements.

  *Internal transactions* are not with outside entities: they are just
  formal transactions created by the accountant.  They there never involve
  cash.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What are the two main categories of adjusting entries?
answer: |
  * Deferred revenues and expenses: this happens when the cashflow has been
     in the past, but revenues and expenses weren't yet realized.
  * Accrued revenues and expenses: in this case, revenues and expenses will
     be recorded now, but the cashflow is in the future.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: Describe *deferred expenses* as a type of adjusting entry, with examples and a template for such a journal entry.
answer: |

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is the goal of *depreciation* and *amortization* and what is the difference between them?
answer: |
  Their purpose is to distribute the original costs of an asset over its useful life.

  *Depreciation* is the term used for physical assets such as trucks and equipment.

  *Amortization* is the term used for abstract assets such as acquired trademarks.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: How is depreciation deducted?
answer: |
  It is deducted from a "Contra Asset Account" (XA) called "Accumulated Depreciation".
  This account has a credit balance and is subtracted from PP&E on the balance sheet to get the "Net Book Value".
  Rather than credit the original account, XA is credited to explicitly keep track of
  the amount of depreciation.

---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is a *contra account*?
answer: |
  It is an account that accumulates deductions to it's companion account.
  Two examples are the Expenses account within the Retained Earnings
  account, and the Accumulated Deprecation account within Assets.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is *straight line depreciation*?
answer: |
  depreciation expense = (original cost - salvage value) / useful life

  The useful life is chosen by management, and salvage value should follow
  from how long they equipment is intended to be used.

question: What is the typical format of an income statement?
answer: |
  * A) Revenues or sales from the core business
  * B) Cost of goods sold
  * C) Gross profit (A - B)
  * D) Operating (SG&A) expense
  * E) Operating income (C - D)
  * F) Interest, gains, and losses
  * G) Pre-tax income (E - F)
  * H) Income tax expense
  * I) Net income (G - H)

  SG&A stands for "selling, general and administrative" -- these are all the
  general period costs.

  Operating income tells us something about the profitability of the core
  business -- whether they priced their products high enough to cover costs.

  Gains and losses are like revenues and expenses, except that the don't come
  from the core business.

  Net income is also called "earning" and "net profit".
