  notes: |
    Still need to write questions for:
    * 2.4.1
    * 2.4.2
    * 2.6

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.1 Financial Reporting Overview
question: What are the required financial statements?
answer: |
  * Balance sheet: financial position on a certain date
  * Income statement: results of operations over a certain period of time using accrual accounting (i.e. according to business activities, not cash flows)
  * Statement of cash flows: sources and uses of cash over a certain period of time
  * Statement of stockholder equity: changes in stockholder equity over a certain period of time

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Cash Flow report?
answer: |
  * CFO: Cash Flow from Operations: from provision of goods and services and other normal business activities
  * CFI: Cash Flow from Investing: from acquisition and disposal of long-lived productive assets
  * CFF: Cash Flow from Financing: from transactions with owners and creditors

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: How does *accrual accounting* relate to cash flow?
answer: >
  It is not directly related to cash flow.
  It calculates transactions based on business activities in a certain time period,
  so for example, while you might have an out-flow of cash for long-lived equipment in
  January, in accrual accounting you would depreciate that expense over the
  equipment's lifetime, rather than considering the full price to be an expense
  in January.

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on an Income Statement?
answer: |
  * Revenues: increases in owner equity from providing goods or services
  * Expenses: decreases in owner equity incurred in the process of generating revenues
  * Net income = Revenues - Expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.1.2 Financial Reporting Example
question: Which sections are on a Balance Sheet?
answer: |
  * Assets: resources owned by the business that are expected to provide future economic benefits
  * Liabilities: claims on assets by creditors
  * Stockholder Equity: claims on assets by owners of the business (contributed capital and retained earnings)

  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the *Balance Sheet Equation*?
answer: |
  Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder Equity

  Another way to say this is: Resources = Claims on Resources by Ousiders and Owners

  A more detailed equation is:

  assets = liabilities + contributed capital + prior retained earnings + revenues - expenses - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What are the two components of *Stockholder's Equity*?
answer: |
  * Contributed capital: money we raise from shareholders
  * Retained earnings: profits from operating the business

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *retained earnings*?
answer: retained earnings = prior retained earnings + net income - dividends

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: What is the equation for *net income*?
answer: Net income = revenues - expenses

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: assets = 100, liabilities = 50, what is stockholder's equity?
answer: |
  50.

  assets (100) = liabilities (50) + stockholder's equity (50)

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: noncash assets = 70, liabilities = 60, stockholder's equity = 30.  What is cash?
answer: |
  20.

  70 + x = 60 + 30

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Retained earnings increases by 100, dividends = 50.  What is net income?
answer: |
  * net income = revenues - expenses
  * retained income = previous retained income + net income - dividends
  * 100 = net income - 50
  * net income = 150

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.1 Balance Sheet Equation
question: Revenue increases by 100 and all other categories are unchanged excepts assets.  What is the change in assets?
answer: |
 100.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be an asset?
answer: |
  * It is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benefits (i.e. generate future cash inflows or reduce cash outflows)
  * It is acquired in a past transaction or exchange
  * The value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC sells $100,000 of merchandise to a customer that promises to pay cash within 60 days?"
answer: |
  Yes.  1) it is expected to provide future cash inflow, 2) it was "acquired" in a transaction, and 3) its future benefit can be estimated.

  It would belong to "Accounts Receivable".

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC signs a contract to deliver $100,000 of natural gas to DEF each month for the next year?"
answer: |
  No, because no products or services have been exchanged.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC pays $12 million for the annual rent on its office building and has already occupied it for one month?"
answer: |
  The asset is "Prepaid Rent" and is worth $11 million.
  $1 million has gone to the "Rent" expense.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this an asset, and if so which account would it be in: BOC's brand name has been estimated to be worth $63 million?"
answer: |
  It is not an asset in financial accounting, because there was no transaction,
  and can't be precisely valued.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are the criteria for considering something to be a liability?
answer: |
  * It is an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services
  * It is based on benefits or services received in the past
  * The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC estimates that it owes $3 million in taxes for the quarter?"
answer: |
  Yes, this is a liability in the "Income Tax Payable" account.
  The "benefits received" criteria is met because we receive the benefit to
  operate the business from the government.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: "Is this a liability, and if so which account would it be in: BOC borrows $500,000 on a one-year note with a 10% interest rate?"
answer: |
  This is a liability in "Notes payable" worth $500,000.
  The interest obligations will only be booked as times passes.

---
reference: Lesson 1.2.2 Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholder's Equity
question: What are *dividends*?
answer: |
  * Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders.
  * They are not considered an expense.
  * They are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date.
  * Until the dividends are actually paid, they become a payable liability.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: What are the three fundamental bookeeping equations?
answer: |
  * assets = liabilities + stockholder's equity
  * sum of debits = sum of credits
  * beginning account balance + increase - decreases = ending account balance

  That first equation is the *balance sheet equation*.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: In accounting, what is the definition of "debits" and "credits"?
answer: >
  A debit is a left-side entry and a credit is a right-side entry in this
  equation:

  assets + expenses = liability + contributed capital + retained earnings + revenues

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: How are "debit" and "credit" abbreviated in accounting?
answer: "Dr." and "Cr.", respectively.

---
reference: Lesson 1.3.1 Debit and Credit Bookkeeping I
question: Are negative debits and credits allowed?
answer: No, all the numbers need to be positive.

question: How do you satisfy the balance sheet equation if liabilities are greater than assets?  Consider that debits and credits are always positive numbers.
answer: |
  Retained earnings (within Shareholder's Equity) is the one account that can have a positive or negative balance, in order to allow for such situations.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: How does *accounting income* differ from *cash in/cash out*?
answer: >
  Accounting income is based on accrual accounting, and it tries to consider
  business activities, rather than cash flow.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing revenues?
answer: |
  Revenue is recognized when BOTH:

  1) Income has been earned (e.g. by providing a product or service), AND
  2) Income has been "realized" (cash has been received or a document which will be converted to cash has been produced, such as a bill)
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What are the criteria for recognizing expenses?
answer: |
  Expenses are recognized:

  * When an associated revenue has been recognized (product costs), OR
  * If it's difficult to associate the expense with a revenue, when the cost has been incurred (period costs or unusual costs).
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What is the *conservatism principle*?
answer: |
  Recognize anticipated losses immediately, but
  only recognized anticipated gains when they are realized.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: How much revenue is recognized in December: BOC leases space to a client for $20,000 for December and January.
answer: |
  $10,000, because they have only earned the income for December so far.
---

reference: Lesson 2.1 Revenues and expenses
question: What is the distinction between *cost* and *expense* in this course?
answer: |
  An expense is only something that goes on the income statement.
  A cost is anything involving an outlay of cash.

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What are *adjusting entries*?
answer: >
  Adjusting entries are internal transactions that update account balances
  in accordance with accrual accounting prior to the preparation of
  financial statements.

  *Internal transactions* are not with outside entities: they are just
  formal transactions created by the accountant.  They there never involve
  cash.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What are the two main categories of adjusting entries?
answer: |
  * Deferred revenues and expenses: this happens when the cashflow has been
     in the past, but revenues and expenses weren't yet realized.
  * Accrued revenues and expenses: in this case, revenues and expenses will
     be recorded now, but the cashflow is in the future.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: Describe *deferred expenses* as a type of adjusting entry, with examples and a template for such a journal entry.
answer: |

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is the goal of *depreciation* and *amortization* and what is the difference between them?
answer: |
  Their purpose is to distribute the original costs of an asset over its useful life.

  *Depreciation* is the term used for physical assets such as trucks and equipment.

  *Amortization* is the term used for abstract assets such as acquired trademarks.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: How is depreciation deducted?
answer: |
  It is deducted from a "Contra Asset Account" (XA) called "Accumulated Depreciation".
  This account has a credit balance and is subtracted from PP&E on the balance sheet to get the "Net Book Value".
  Rather than credit the original account, XA is credited to explicitly keep track of
  the amount of depreciation.

---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is a *contra account*?
answer: |
  It is an account that accumulates deductions to it's companion account.
  Two examples are the Expenses account within the Retained Earnings
  account, and the Accumulated Deprecation account within Assets.
---

reference: Lesson 2.3.1 Adjusting Entries I
question: What is *straight line depreciation*?
answer: |
  depreciation expense = (original cost - salvage value) / useful life

  The useful life is chosen by management, and salvage value should follow
  from how long they equipment is intended to be used.

question: What is the *adjusted trial balance*?
answer: |
  We add everything up after creating the adjusting entries, and make sure
  that debits equal credits.  The balances are used to make financial statements.
---

reference: Lesson 2.5 Financial Statements and Closing Entries
question: In what order are financial statements prepared?
answer: |
  * After creating adjusting entries and the adjusted trial balance,
      the Income Statement is prepared first.
  * Then Net Income is used to update Retained Earnings and prepare the
      Balance Sheet.
  * Finally, the Statement of Cash Flows and Statement are Stockholder's
      Equity are completed.

reference: Lesson 2.5 Financial Statements and Closing Entries
question: What is the typical format of an income statement?
answer: |
  * A) Revenues or sales from the core business
  * B) Cost of goods sold
  * C) Gross profit (A - B)
  * D) Operating (SG&A) expense
  * E) Operating income (C - D)
  * F) Interest, gains, and losses
  * G) Pre-tax income (E - F)
  * H) Income tax expense
  * I) Net income (G - H)

  SG&A stands for "selling, general and administrative" -- these are all the
  general period costs.

  Operating income tells us something about the profitability of the core
  business -- whether they priced their products high enough to cover costs.

  Gains and losses are like revenues and expenses, except that the don't come
  from the core business.

  Net income is also called "earnings" and "net profit".

  Then come liabilities (ordered by liquidity):

  * Current liabilities (obligations within the next year):
      * Bank borrowings
      * Accounts payable and other payables
      * Deferred revenues and other non-cash liabilities

question: What are *temporary accounts*?
answer: |
  They are accounts which accumulate the effects of transactions for a
  single period.  In particular, these are the revenue and expense
  accounts, which get closed out to retained earnings at the end of the period.
---

reference: Lesson 2.5 Financial Statements and Closing Entries
question: What are *permanent accounts*?
answer: |
  They are accounts which accumulate the effects of transactions over the life
  of the business.
  This includes balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, contributed
  capital, retained earnings).
---

reference: Lesson 2.5 Financial Statements and Closing Entries
question: What are *closing entries* and when do you use them?
answer: |
  Closing entries close out one reporting period and allow us to start the next period.

  They are used for closing temporary accounts, which means to zero them out
  via internal transactions.
  In particular, we want to transfer the balances aof the Revenue and Expense
  accounts to Retained Earnings.

  They are created as the last part of the accounting cycle, after
  the financial statements are prepared.
---

reference: Lesson 2.5 Financial Statements and Closing Entries
question: What is the *post-closing trial balance*?
answer: |
  It summarizes the balances of permanent accounts after closing entires.
  The debits should equal the credits.
  All revenue and expense accounts should have a zero balance at the point.

reference: Lesson 3.1.1 Operating, Investing, and Financial Cash Flows
question: What is the format of the *Statement of Cash Flows*?
answer: |
  1) Net cash from operating activities
  2) Net cash from investing activities
  3) Net cash from financing activities
  4) The total sum is the net change in cash balance
  5) Additional required disclosures should be at the bottom of the statement or in footnotes:
      a) Non-cash transactions (such as trading land for a building)
      b) Cash interest paid
      c) Cash income taxes paid

reference: Lesson 3.1.1 Operating, Investing, and Financial Cash Flows
question: Which transactions are included in *operating activities* on the Cash Flow Statement?
answer: |
  For cash inflows:
  * Collections from customers
  * (US only) Receipts of interest and dividends on investments

  For cash outflows:
  * Payments to suppliers
  * Payments to employees
  * Payments of taxes
  * Other operating disbursements
  * (US only) Payments of interest

  Cash outflows exclude these income statements items:
  * Depreciation and amortization (and other noncash items)
  * Gains or losses on disposal of PP&E

  Note for the USA, FASB has some strange deviating requirements.
  It seems strange to include investment and financing activities related to
  interest and dividends in the Operating activities section.
  The reasoning is that FASB decided they want to include most items from the
  income statement within Operating Activities.

reference: Lesson 3.2.1 Operating, Investing, and Financial Cash Flows
question: Describe the two methods for preparing the Statement of Cash Flows.
answer: |
  The "direct method":
  * List cash transactions by source/use of funds
  * Always used for investing and financing activities
  * Not normally used for operating activity, because the "indirect" method is required here by some institutions

  The "indirect method":
  * Only used for operating activities
  * Goal is to reconcile Net Income with cash from operations by removing
      non-cash items and investing activities from net income and including additional cash flows
      not in net income
