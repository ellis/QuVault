question: Describe the single-source shortest paths problem.
answer: "Find the shortest paths from a single source $s$ to all other nodes in a graph $G$.\n\n*Input*: Directed graph $G = (V, E), edge lengths $c_e$ (possibly negative), source vertex $s \\in V$.\n\n*Goal*: either\n  \n  A) For all destinations $v \\in V$, compute the length of a shortest $s-v$ path, or\n  B) Output a negative cycle\n"

question: Describe the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
answer: >
  A dynamic programming algorithm for solving the single-shource shortest paths
  problem.

  ```scala

  for (i <- 1 to n) {

     A(0, i) = if (i == s) 0 else Int.MaxValue

  }



  for (i <- 1 until n) {

     for (v <- V) {

        val minUsingV = E.filter(x => x._2 == v).map({ case (w, _, cwv) => A(i
  - 1)(w) + cwv }).min

        A(i, v) = math.min(A(i - 1, v), minUsingV)

     }

question: Describe the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
answer: >
  This is dynamic programming algorithm to solve the all-pairs shortest paths
  problem.

  Recurrence A[i,j,k] = min{A[i,j,k-1], A[i,k,k-1] + A[k,j,k-1]}



  ```scala

  for {

     k <- 1 to n

     i <- 1 to n

     j <- 1 to n

  } {

     A(i)(j)(k) = math.min(A(i)(j)(k-1), A(i)(k)(k-1) + A(k)(j)(k-1))

  }
