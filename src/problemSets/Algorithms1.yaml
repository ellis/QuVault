question: Recall the Master Method ($T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n^d)$) and its three parameters $a,b,d$. Which of the following is the best interpretation of $bd$, in the context of divide-and-conquer algorithms?
answer: The rate at which the work-per-subproblem is shrinking (per level of recursion).
---
question: What does it mean for a graph to be strongly connected?
answer: (I think) there is a path from every node to every other node

question: Describe the single-source shortest paths problem.
answer: |
  Find the shortest paths from a single source $s$ to all other nodes in a graph $G$.

  *Input*: Directed graph $G = (V, E), edge lengths $c_e$ (possibly negative), source vertex $s \in V$.
  
  *Goal*: either
    
    A) For all destinations $v \in V$, compute the length of a shortest $s-v$ path, or
    B) Output a negative cycle

question: Describe the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
answer: |
  A dynamic programming algorithm for solving the single-shource shortest paths problem.
  ```scala
  for (i <- 1 to n) {
     A(0, i) = if (i == s) 0 else Int.MaxValue
  }

  for (i <- 1 until n) {
     for (v <- V) {
        val minUsingV = E.filter(x => x._2 == v).map({ case (w, _, cwv) => A(i - 1)(w) + cwv }).min
        A(i, v) = math.min(A(i - 1, v), minUsingV)
     }
  }
  ```

question: Describe the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
answer: |
  This is dynamic programming algorithm to solve the all-pairs shortest paths problem.
  Recurrence A[i,j,k] = min{A[i,j,k-1], A[i,k,k-1] + A[k,j,k-1]}

  ```scala
  for {
     k <- 1 to n
     i <- 1 to n
     j <- 1 to n
  } {
     A(i)(j)(k) = math.min(A(i)(j)(k-1), A(i)(k)(k-1) + A(k)(j)(k-1))
  }
  ```
