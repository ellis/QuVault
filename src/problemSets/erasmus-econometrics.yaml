question: For the linear model $y_i = β_1 + β_2 x_{2i} + ... + β_k + x_{ki} + ε_i$, what happens to $y$ if $x_j$ increases by one unit while all other $x$-variables remain fixed?
answer: >
  $y$ will increase by $\beta_j$.  You can find this by taking the partial
  derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_j$:

  $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} = \beta_j$$

question: For the linear model $y_i = β_1 + β_2 x_{2i} + ... + β_k + x_{ki} + ε_i$, what is the total effect of a change in $x_j$ on $y$ if the $x$ factors are mutually dependent?
answer: >
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{dy}{dx_j}
   &= \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} + \sum_{h=2,h \ne j}^k\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_h}\frac{\partial x_h}{\partial x_j}
   &= \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j} + \sum_{h=2,h \ne j}^k\beta_h\frac{\partial x_h}{\partial x_j}
  \end{align}$$

question: Prove that rank(X) = k implies that X'X is invertible (where X has k columns).
answer: >
  X'X is a symmetric matrix.  A symmetric matrix with full rank is invertible.
