answer: |
  This is tricky.

question: What is the *Market Strategy Game*?
answer: |
  * Plot where your company is on the three axes.

question: Explain the concept of the *long tail*.
answer: |
  Consider this in terms of the popularity of items on Amazon.  Rank all items
  by sales (descending) and plot sales vs item.  The most popular items will be
  sold much more than less popular items.  Before internet sales were so common,
  stores would only stock the most popular items, because the less popular items
  didn't sell enough to be worth the costs.  But the profit that can be made
  off of the long tail is significant if the customers can find you and you
  can ship cheaply.

  Explainations for the long tail are:

  * supply-side: companies can offer more variety due to easier distribution than in the past
  * demand-side: customers can search for products on the internet that fit their precises wishes; they can read reviews

question: Would a small physical store likely sell from "head" or the "long tail"?  Why?
answer: From the head, because many more customers will be interested in the products in the head rather than the long tail.

---
reference: Week 3 Lesson 4
question: People who don’t read a lot of books tend to read best-sellers.  Discuss this trend.
answer: |
  This is also called the "Law of Natural Monopoly".  Generally, if a person
  isn't involved in an area much (e.g. reading books, watching movies), they
  tend to enjoy and consume the most popular products rather than niche ones.
