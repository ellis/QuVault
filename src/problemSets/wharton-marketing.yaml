What about S.T.P. (P=Positioning, brand)?

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: What is marketing?
answer: |
  It is the study of markets, which are mediums of exchange (typically between
  a buyer and a seller).

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: What is a *buyer's market*? What is a *seller's market*?
answer: >
  A buyer's market is a market in which the buyers have more power to determine
  the conditions of exchange.  The converse is true for a seller's market.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: Describe the discipline of marketing in a seller's market.
answer: |
  * In a seller's market, the customers are coming to you for your product.
  * To maximize profitability in these conditions, you want to maximize your sales volume and market share.
  * This involves increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and making the best
    product you can.
  * Growth comes from developing new products based on your experience or going
    to new markets.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: Describe the discipline of marketing in a buyer's market.
answer: |
  * In a buyer's market, the focus is on customers and the competition,
    because you want to customer to buy from you instead of the competition.
  * The best way to do that is to look at what the customer wants and meet
    the needs of the customer.
  * The interesting factor here is that every customer wants something
    different, and you can't give everybody what they want.
  * So the key is to choose only certain customers.
  * In this scenario, you aim to create value rather than increase sales volume.
  * Profitability comes from either an increased price such customers are
    willing to pay, or through keeping long-term customers.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: What is *customer share*?
answer: |
  Rather than going after more customers (i.e. market share), you aim to
  increase your share of the customer's expenditures.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: Why is customer loyalty valuable for customer oriented companies?
answer: |
  It's very expensive to figure out what your customers want.
  Once you've figured it out, if that customer stays loyal to your brand,
  it's cheaper to deliver it to them repeatedly.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: What is the notion of *cross selling*?
answer: >
  Cross selling is when a customer buys something and you try to sell them a complementary
  product to go along with the first purchase.
  Example: you go buy a pair of pants, and the sales person asks if you need a belt with it too.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: Where does profitability come from in a customer-based market?
answer: |
  In a customer-based market, profitability comes from:

  * giving the customer exactly what they want,
    so they're willing to pay a premium price
  * they become loyal customers and purchase over time
  * and you engage in cross-selling additional products to meet their needs

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: What is meant by *connected community* and *customer experience*?
answer: |
  Customers will discuss their experiences with your company online, and
  this will influence the attitudes of others in their communities towards
  your company.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 1
question: List four different marketing "orientations", their competitive advantages, etc.
answer: |
  * Production orientation
      * pursuade the customer to want the products the company offers
      * provides generic products
      * competitive advantage is in lowest production cost through large volume
      * profitability comes from market share
  * Marketing orientation
      * pursuade the company to develop products for the customers
      * provides differentiated products
      * competitive advantage is in quality and customer data for delivering value to customers, engendering customer loyalty, and cross-selling.
      * profitability comes from customer share
  * Experience orientation
      * try to manage the customers entire experience related to the company
      * provides experiential value

      * provides genuine value
      * competitive advantage is in trust
      * profitability comes from reduced costs passed onto customers

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 2
question: Describe the *3 Principles of Marketing*.
answer: |
  * Value: you need to provide real value to customers in order for them to buy from you.
  * Differentiation: you need to provide what the customer wants better than the competition.
  * Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning: when in a customer-focused market,
      you can't meet everyone's needs, so you 1) identify customer segments in the market, 2)
      target one of those segments, and 3) position your brand to meet the needs
      of that target segment.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 2
question: What are the *4 P's of Marketing*?
answer: |
  These are the "tools" for working on the "3 principles of marketing".

  * Product -- what the company provides
  * Place -- where the product is available to the customer
  * Promotion -- the means of making the customer aware of the product
  * Price -- what the customer provides

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 2
question: Illustrate the "4 P's of Marketing" using the example of the blood drive by the American Red Cross.
answer: |
  * Product: feel good about having donated
      * "you're going to help save lives"
      * customer gets a sticker for their jacket that they donated
      * customers were given orange juice and cookies
  * Place: they had a "blood mobile" and went to the customers
  * Promotion: how they communicated the benefits of giving blood
  * Price: blood

  Some of the most successful blood drives were in high school, and one of the
  most successful "products" was to let them miss class.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: What are the Market-Driven Principles?
answer: |
  1) Know your markets
  2) Customers have the final say
  3) Commit to being first in the markets you server
  4) Deliver total quality to guarantee customer satisfaction

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: Define *fair-value*
answer: The cost to customers should be proportionate to the product's perceived benefits.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: What are the three *bundles* that Barbara Kahn talks about?
answer: |
  There are three strategies for leadership:

  * Operational excellence: allows you to reduce price.
  * Performance superiority: delivers on product design and style.
  * Customer intimacy: familiarity with customer needs and trying to deliver something that is responsive to their needs.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: What should a company aim for with regard to their product and the three bundles?
answer: You need to offer fair-value on two dimensions and superior value on one dimension.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: How do you ascertain the fair-value on one of the dimensions?
answer: |
  This is tricky.
  Sometimes people think of it as the average (e.g. average price, average stylishness, average customization).
  Sometimes, few companies offer fair value, such as airlines might not deliver on expected operational excellence (not being on-time).

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: What is the *Market Strategy Game*?
answer: |
  * Plot where your company is on the three axes.
  * Plot where the competition is on the three axes.
  * Try to figure out what you should be doing right now to beat the competition.
  * If you're inadequate on one dimension, you might focus on that first.
  * Long-term, you're looking to be the **best** on one dimension and adequate on the other two.

  That one dimension forms your leadership strategy.

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 3
question: What are the qualities of companies that follow different leadership strategies?
answer: |
  Operational firms tend to be hierarchical and efficient.
  Design firms tend to be artistic, independent, and creative.
  Customer firms tend to have a "yes-culture" and be somewhat like consultants.

---

---
reference: Week 1 Lesson 4

  * Segment size
  * Growth of segment
  * Value of segment

question: What is *customer centricity*?
answer: |
  Customer centricity is a strategy that aligns a company's development/delivery
  of its products/services around the current and future needs of a select set
  of customers in order to maximize their long-term financial value to the firm.

---
reference: Week 2 Lesson 6
question: What can you say about who sales is different for a customer-centric company?
answer: |
  Needs to maximize long-term value, not short-term.  Don't incentive sales people
  to get short-term sales, but build long-term value.

---
reference: Week 3 Lesson 4
question: Explain the concept of the *long tail*.
answer: |
  Consider this in terms of the popularity of items on Amazon.  Rank all items
  by sales (descending) and plot sales vs item.  The most popular items will be
  sold much more than less popular items.  Before internet sales were so common,
  stores would only stock the most popular items, because the less popular items
  didn't sell enough to be worth the costs.  But the profit that can be made
  off of the long tail is significant if the customers can find you and you
  can ship cheaply.

  Explainations for the long tail are:

  * supply-side: companies can offer more variety due to easier distribution than in the past
  * demand-side: customers can search for products on the internet that fit their precises wishes; they can read reviews

---
reference: Week 3 Lesson 4
question: Would a small physical store likely sell from "head" or the "long tail"?  Why?
answer: From the head, because many more customers will be interested in the products in the head rather than the long tail.

---
reference: Week 3 Lesson 4
question: People who don’t read a lot of books tend to read best-sellers.  Discuss this trend.
answer: |
  This is also called the "Law of Natural Monopoly".  Generally, if a person
  isn't involved in an area much (e.g. reading books, watching movies), they
  tend to enjoy and consume the most popular products rather than niche ones.
