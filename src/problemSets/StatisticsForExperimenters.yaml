question: |
  Suppose you have two samples A, and B, each with 10 observations.
  You assume that the observations in each sample are IID,
  and that both samples come from populations with similar shapes.
  In particular, both populations have the same variance.

  1) Calculate the standard error of the difference in averages.
  2) Comment on the normality of $\bar{y}_B - \bar{y}_A$
answer: |
  $$\begin{aligned}
  Var(\bar{y}_A) &= \sigma^2 / n_A \\
  Var(\bar{y}_B) &= \sigma^2 / n_B \\
  Var(\bar{y}_B - \bar{y}_A) &= \sigma^2 / n_B + \sigma^2 / n_A + 2Cov(\bar{y}_B, \bar{y}_A) \\
   &= \sigma^2 (1 / n_B + 1 / n_A) \\
  s.e. &= \sigma \sqrt{1 / n_B + 1 / n_A}
  \end{aligned}$$

  Due to the central limit effect with $n=10$, $\bar{y}_B - \bar{y}_A$ should be reasonably
  normal if the underlying populations are not too extremely non-normal.
  Given our assumptions,
  $$z = \frac{(\bar{y}_B - \bar{y}_A) - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{1 / n_B + 1 / n_A}}$$
  should be approximately normal.
