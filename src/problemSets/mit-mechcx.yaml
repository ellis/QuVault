question: Define "interaction"
---
quesiton: Add vectors and write a vector in its x and y components
---
quesiton: State Newton's Laws
---
quesiton: State Newton's 1st Law
answer: |
  A body which is not subject to external forces will maintain constant velocity (which may be 0).

  $$\vec{F}_{net} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \vec{v} = \text{const}$$
---
question: Describe *inertia*
answer: the tendency of matter to maintain its state of rest or motion with constant velocity.
---
quesiton: Define the net force in terms of the individual forces
---
quesiton: Define the term "free body diagram"
---
quesiton: Use double subscript notation to indicate the forces between interacting objects
---
question: What is a *newton*?
answer: The units of force, named in honor of Newton and his second law $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$.  $N = kg\cdot m / s^2$
---
question: What are the units of force?
answer: $\left[\vec{F}\right] = N = kg\cdot m / s^2$
---
question: What is Newton's 2nd law?
answer: $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$
---
question: What can you say about the direction of force and acceleration?
answer: They are parallel, always moving in the same direction.
---
question: What can you say about the claim "force causes motion"?
answer: |
  This is false.  Things can move without force, such as a rocket in outer space.
  Instead, force causes changes in motion.
---
question: What is *weight*?
answer: The force of gravity.  $\vec{w} = m\vec{g}$ and $w = mg$.
---
question: You place a stone on a table, and it stays there.  How does the table know to exert the exact force upward in order to counteract the force of gravity?
answer: It compresses a bit.  The table is like a spring.  The more it compresses, the more counter-force it exerts.
