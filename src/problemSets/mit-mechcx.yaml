question: Define "interaction"
---
quesiton: Add vectors and write a vector in its x and y components
---
quesiton: State Newton's Laws
---
quesiton: State Newton's 1st Law
answer: |
  A body which is not subject to external forces will maintain constant velocity (which may be 0).

  $$\vec{F}_{net} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \vec{v} = \text{const}$$

  (This is also known as Galileo's Law of Inertia)
---
question: Describe *inertia*
answer: the tendency of matter to maintain its state of rest or motion with constant velocity.
---
quesiton: Define the net force in terms of the individual forces
---
quesiton: Define the term "free body diagram"
---
quesiton: Use double subscript notation to indicate the forces between interacting objects
---
question: What is a *newton*?
answer: |
  The units of force, named in honor of Newton and his second law $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$.  $N = kg\cdot m / s^2$
---
question: What are the units of force?
answer: $\left[\vec{F}\right] = N = kg\cdot m / s^2$
---
question: The newton is a "derived unit".  Why have newtons when the same quanity can be defined by simpler units?
answer: |
  Because force is so important and commonly considered.  And although
  $1 N = 1 kg\cdot m / s^2$, it's not so intuitive that force is related
  to length and time: you wouldn't normally want to tell a person that your
  weight is $X$ kg m / s².
---
question: What is Newton's 2nd law?
answer: $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$
---
question: What can you say about the direction of force and acceleration?
answer: They are parallel, always moving in the same direction.
---
question: What can you say about the claim "force causes motion"?
answer: |
  This is false.  Things can move without force, such as a rocket in outer space.
  Instead, force causes changes in motion.
---
question: What is *weight*?
answer: The force of gravity.  $\vec{w} = m\vec{g}$ and $w = mg$.
---
question: You place a stone on a table, and it stays there.  How does the table know to exert the exact force upward in order to counteract the force of gravity?
answer: It compresses a bit.  The table is like a spring.  The more it compresses, the more counter-force it exerts.
---
question: What is *momentum*?
answer: |
  momentum = $m\vec{v}$, is a kind of "quantity of motion": how much, in which direction, and at what speed.
---
question: Express Netwon's second law as a *LAW OF CHANGE* (e.g. a differential equation).
answer: |
  $$\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}_{net}}{m}$$
---
question: What is the difference between $\vec{F}_{net}$ and $m\vec{a}$?
answer: |
  Repeat this to yourself as often as necessary: $m\vec{a}$ is not a force! It should never be put on your free body diagram -- it is the **result** of forces.
---
question: What are the three base *dimensions* needed for classical mechanics?
answer: They are length, time, and mass.
---
question: What are the dimensions for velocity and acceleration?
answer: They are length/time and length/time², respectively.
---
question: What is the distinction between the *dimensions* and *units* of force?
answer: |
  The dimensions involve mass, length, and time; whereas the units are relative
  to a specific system of units, such as the SI units: $kg\cdot m/s^2$.
---
question: Describe the effect of a 1N push.
answer: |
  It would cause a 1kg object to accelerate away at 1 m/s².
