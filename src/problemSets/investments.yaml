question: How has the U.S. stock market performed over the 80 years up to 2015?

---
question: 'What is the *Sharpe ratio*?'
answer: "It is the return of an equity beyond the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the equity: $\\frac{r_e - r_f}{\\sigma_e}$\nThis gives you a sense of how well the asset performs relative to its riskiness."

---
question: 'What are *dominated* assets, and what should you do about them?'
answer: >
  A dominated asset is one whose returns are lower than another asset with the
  same risk.  For example, if two mutual funds have the same investment strategy,
  the one with the higher management cost will be a dominated asset.

  You should not invest in dominated assets.

question: 'What is the *tangency portfolio*?'
answer: The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.

---
question: 'What is the *Separation Theorem*?'
answer: >
  The idea that you should allocate your investment between two assets:
  a risk-free asset (e.g. treasury bills), and the Tangency Portfolio of risky
  assets. Assuming that borrowing from the risk-free asset is allowed, this
  combination allows for the highest returns (i.e. the highest Sharpe ratio) at
  every risk level.

---
question: What is the relationship between the tangency portfolio and the market portfolio?
answer: >
  If everyone were to invest according to the separation theorem, that would
  imply that the trangency portfolio would be the same as the market portfolio.

question: What is CAPM?
answer: "CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model. Every asset has an $\\alpha$ and a $\\beta$ value. $\\beta$ quantifies the sensitivity of the asset to the overall market. In other words, when the market rises 1 point, the asset rises $\\beta$ points. $\\alpha$ quantifies the excess return of the asset beyond the average."

---
question: "For an asset with a high $\\beta$, what does the CAPM model predict to happen when the market is doing well or poorly?"
answer: "When the market is doing well, the asset will do even better by a factor of $\\beta$. When the market is doing poorly, the asset will do even worse by a factor of $\\beta$."

reference: Module 3
question: "How well does CAPM $\\beta$ actually predict returns?"
answer: "In general, the correlation is not particularly strong.  However, on days when macroeconomic news comes out, the extent of movement of the stock price is strongly related to $\\beta$."

reference: Module 3
question: "Besides CAPM $\\beta$, what are other factors that predict returns?"
answer: |
  Some include firm size, value vs growth, and momentum.

question: 'What is meant by *market efficiency*?'
answer: >
  Stock prices should reflect all public information, including past stock
  returns and accounting data.

---
reference: Module 3
question: There are factors that somewhat predict returns; what does this indicate about the principle of market efficiency?
answer: >
  * If the factor represents risk, then its ability to predict returns doesn't
  violate market efficiency.

  * It may indicate some form of market inefficiency.

  * It may simply be a false conclusion of data mining lots of factors.

reference: Module 4
question: What are the two ways discussed in the course to value a firm?
answer: >
  * Market multiples approach: requires finding a similar firm with similar
  accounting practices

  * Discounted cash flow
