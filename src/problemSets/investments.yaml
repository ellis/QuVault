  sourceTitle: Investments

question: How has the U.S. stock market performed over the last at years (as of 2015)?
answer: >
  U.S. stock market outperformed U.S. Treasury Bills by 8% per year on average.
  Small stocks outperformed the overall market by about another 8%.
---
question: How can you reduce risk in a portfolio?
answer: >
  Mix assets with low correlation.
---
question: What is the *Sharpe ratio*?
answer: >
  It is the return of an equity beyond the risk-free return, divided by
  the standard deviation of the equity: $\frac{r_e - r_f}{\sigma_e}$

  This gives you a sense of how well the asset performs relative to its
  riskiness.
---
question: What are *dominated* assets, and what should you do about them?
answer: >
  A dominated asset is one whose returns are lower than another asset with
  the same risk.  For example, if two mutual funds have the same investment
  strategy, the one with the higher management cost will be a dominated asset.

  You should not invest in dominated assets.
---
question: What is the *tangency portfolio*?
answer: The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.
---
question: What is the *Separation Theorem*?
answer: >
  The idea that you should allocate your investment between two assets:
  a risk-free asset (e.g. treasury bills), and the Tangency Portfolio of risky assets.
  Assuming that borrowing from the risk-free asset is allowed,
  this combination allows for the highest returns (i.e. the highest Sharpe
  ratio) at every risk level.
---
question: What is the relationship between the tangency portfolio and the market portfolio?
answer: >
  If everyone were to invest according to the separation theorem,
  that would imply that the trangency portfolio would be the same as the
  market portfolio.
---
question: What is CAPM?
answer: >
  CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model.
  Every asset has an $\alpha$ and a $\beta$ value.
  $\beta$ quantifies the sensitivity of the asset to the overall market.
  In other words, when the market rises 1 point, the asset rises $\beta$ points.
  $\alpha$ quantifies the excess return of the asset beyond the average.
---
question: For an asset with a high $\beta$, what does the CAPM model predict to happen when the market is doing well or poorly?
answer: >
  When the market is doing well, the asset will do even better by a factor of $\beta$.
  When the market is doing poorly, the asset will do even worse by a factor of $\beta$.
---
reference: Module 3
question: How well does CAPM $\beta$ actually predict returns?
answer: >
  In general, the correlation is not particularly strong.  However, on days
  when macroeconomic news comes out, the extent of movement of the stock price
  is strongly related to $\beta$.
---
reference: Module 3
question: Besides CAPM $\beta$, what are other factors that predict returns?
answer: |
  Some include firm size, value vs growth, and momentum.
---
reference: Module 3
question: What is meant by *market efficiency*?
answer: >
  Stock prices should reflect all public information, including past stock
  returns and accounting data.
---
reference: Module 3
question: There are factors that somewhat predict returns; what does this indicate about the principle of market efficiency?
answer: >
  * If the factor represents risk, then its ability to predict returns doesn't violate market efficiency.
  * It may indicate some form of market inefficiency.
  * It may simply be a false conclusion of data mining lots of factors.
---
reference: Module 4
question: What are the two ways discussed in the course to value a firm?
answer: >
  * Market multiples approach: requires finding a similar firm with similar accounting practices
  * Discounted cash flow
